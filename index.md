## Description

This workshop explores the dynamic intersection of AI and music, a rapidly evolving field where creativity meets computation. Music is one of the most universal and emotionally resonant forms of human expression. Producing, understanding, and processing music presents unique challenges for machine learning due to its creative, expressive, subjective, and interactive nature. According to the IFPI Global Music Report 2025 published by the International Federation of the Phonographic Industry (IFPI), "*AI will be one of the defining issues of our time and record companies have embraced its potential to enhance artist creativity and develop new and exciting fan experiences.*" AI has tremendous impacts on all aspects of music, across composition, production, performance, distribution, and education. Recent years have also seen rapidly growing interests among the machine learning community in AI music research. In this first NeurIPS workshop dedicated to music since 2011, we want to bring together the music and AI communities to facilitate a timely, interdisciplinary conversation on the status and future of AI for music.

The goal of this workshop is twofold: First, we aim to explore the latest advancements of AI's applications for music, from analysis, creation, performance, production, retrieval to music education and therapy. Second, we aim to discuss the impacts and implications of AI in music, including AI's impacts on the music industry, musician community, and music education as well as ethical, legal and societal implications of AI music and AI's implications for future musicians. We will emphasize networking and community building in this workshop to generate a sustainable research momentum.

The workshop will feature invited talks, contributed spotlight presentations, a poster and demo session, a panel discussion, and round table discussions. We have invited six speakers from a diverse background who will bring interdisciplinary perspectives to the audience. We will solicit original 4-page papers from the community. We will also call for demos accompanied by 2-page extended abstracts to accommodate the various formats AI music innovations may take.

## Call for Papers & Demos

We invite contributions from the community on relevant topics of AI and music, *broadly defined*. This workshop is **non-archival**{:.accent}. Accepted papers will be posted on the workshop website but will not be published or archived. We welcome work that is under review or to be submitted to other venues.

**Submission portal**{:.accent}: [openreview.net/group?id=NeurIPS.cc/2025/Workshop/AI4Music](https://openreview.net/group?id=NeurIPS.cc/2025/Workshop/AI4Music)

### Call for Papers

We call for original **4-page papers**{:.accent} (excluding references) on relevant topics of AI and music, broadly defined. We encourage and welcome papers discussing initial concepts, early results, and promising directions. All accepted papers will be presented in the poster and demo session. A small number of papers will be selected for 10-min spotlight presentations. The review process will be **double-blind**{:.accent}.

### Call for Demos

We call for demos of novel AI music tools and artistic work. Each demo submission will be accompanied by a **2-page extended abstract**{:.accent} (excluding references). We encourage the authors to submit an **optional short video recording**{:.accent} (no longer than 10 min) as supplementary materials.
